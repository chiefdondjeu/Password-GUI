# Password-GUI

NewPasswords.java is a redo of an old project I did when I took cosc 117 freshman year. My old project file, Passwords.java, is also included in here.The only significant difference is I used GUI.

I compiled my program using java SE "13.0.2". In my makefile, to run the new project, type: "make all" and to run the old project, type: 'make old", and "make runold".
